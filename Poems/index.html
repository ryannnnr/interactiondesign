      <h1>Poems I Stole from the Internet</h1>

        <h2>Jagged Winter Trail Designs</h2>
        <p>The wagon and mule, Time and Eternity, stop to change places.
          Their lean and slope-back shadow, my reservation. The moon moves like infested flour.
          At the river, bloody victories meet bloody massacres. They tell each other about their dead.
     Grandmothers eat buffalo instead of hamburger. After supper, guitar chords bite through gravestone.
     Then the one grandfather interrupts, walking off with his own skull as a lantern into the polar night.
     Snowshoe hare cleans the ears of the sleeping and leaves prophetic dreams.
     It is quiet. One can hear the hair of the dead grow.
     The woods, itself, dressed in frozen children’s clothes.
     Few of the living disguise themselves as pawned beadwork.</p>

        <h2>Sugar Water in winter</h2>
        <p>A bowl of rose water dreams itself empty
on the radiator: It's December and we can
hardly afford the heat, our milk money
crinkling hungry over the cold counter
of our convenience store, the very last
of our cash for creamer, for pleasantries,
for cheap tea and cigarettes, for the barely-
there scent of roses burning softly. We trade
our hungers for hearth, for the clank and hiss
of warmth. Small fires, these, but even we,
in our clamorous poverty, demand pleasure:
steal sugar, our neighbor's flowers, and never,
ever are caught thankless in better weather.</p>

          <h2>White Lie</h2>
          <p>Christmas Eves our dad would bring
Home from the farm real hay
For the reindeer that didn't exist
And after we were finally asleep
Would get out and take the slabs
Up in his arms and carry them
Back to the bed of his pickup,
Making sure to litter the snow
With chaff so he could show us
In the morning the place where
They'd stood eating, their harness
Bells dulled by the cold, their breath
Steam, all while we were dreaming.</p>

            <h2>Might Have Been July, Might Have Been December</h2>
            <p>More oblique the eagle’s angle
than the osprey’s precipitous fall,
but rose up both and under them dangled
a trout, the point of it all.

Festooned, a limb on each one’s
favored tree either side of the river,
with chains of bone and lace of skin
the river’s wind made shiver.

Sat under them both, one in December,
one in July, in diametrical seasonal airs,
and once arrived home, as I remember,
with a thin white fish rib lodged in my hair.</p>
