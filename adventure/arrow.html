          The arrow was the right choice, good job. You were able to protect yourself because you killed the animal from a distance and ran away. You start to notice some light down the path. You keep walking and the light is getting bigger and brighter.
      </p>
      <p>
        You finally get to the light and rather than it being a sign that you were out of the woods. It actually is a box. It is shining too bright for you to be able to tell what is it. You are very intrigued but donâ€™t know what to do with it. Should you pick it up or does it seems too risky and want to leave and keep walking?
