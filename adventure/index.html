          You find yourself in the woods late one night. After a long day of trying to find your way out of the woods, you’re starting to lose hope. You have been following the path but it never seems to end. You seem to be walking in circles and just can not figure out why. Your phone is dead so you can not find you’re way out.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a long time of just a straight and narrow path, you find you’re self at a fork. Path one has many trees lining it. It seems to have been walked on before, with little to no grass growing on the path.
</p>
<p>
  Path two is a different story. It seems to be way darker than path one. The path is very overgrown and seems more dangerous.
