          Your risk paid off, path 2 was the right choice. But maybe a mile into path two you start to hear a noise. It sounds like an animal. It's not an animal sound you have ever heard before. The animal is coming closer and you can finally make out what it is. You need to act first before the animal attacks you. You see two weapons on the ground. One is a knife and one is a bow and arrow. You have to decide which one will protect you.
